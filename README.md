# numberCheckCodeRecognizer
It is used to recognize a checkcode on website, and there are many restricts, so now it is not very useful. For example, the check code cannot be rotated, and cannot be stretched.
But it can be used as a template, for your own checkcode recognization.
This project uses machine learning, but the efficiency is very low, especially when the argument is set high.
